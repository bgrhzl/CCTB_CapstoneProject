// This script will replace the default avatar.png with the latest uploaded user profile photo if the user uploads a new one.
// It will also ensure the file extension is .jpg or .jpeg if the uploaded file is in that format.
// This is a placeholder. The actual logic is handled in the backend and frontend upload/update logic.
// No code is needed here, but this file is created to document the avatar update logic.
